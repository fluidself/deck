# DECK

DECK is a note-taking app with built-in decentralized access control. Individuals can compile their ideas, thoughts, and notes in an interconnected context and make connections between them. DAOs and other communities can create knowledge bases and set up granular access control based on on-chain conditions such as ownership of an NFT or token.
